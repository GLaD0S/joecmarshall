This October I'll be releasing my first book with Packt publishing, *Hands-On Bug Bounties for Penetration Testers*. 

The book covers:

- Preparing for pentesting engagements
- Building an automated pentesting workflow
- Detecting and reporting OWASP's Top 10 most common bugs
- Finding the best bug bounty programs
- Focusing on testing the right parts of a web application
- Formatting vulnerability reports to maximize your payouts
- Going further

If you have some experience with penetration testing, it'll be a good introduction to public bug bounty programs, and if you're just getting into security, it's a great series of walkthroughs for getting up to speed - even if you have to search for the meaning of a term or two (or three).
