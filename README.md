# Hi

This is the repo for my personal blog, a static site generated with Hugo (using the Pickles theme). You can find it at [joecmarshall.com](https://joecmarshall.com)

I use this site in combination with [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host a simple, static blog, that's easy to update and maintain.

Thanks for checking it out!
